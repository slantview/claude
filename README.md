- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimizations
- Technical debt discussions
- Code review feedback

### Communication Standards
- **Terse Professional** - Senior engineer communication style
- **No AI References** - Never mention automation or AI assistance
- **Platform Appropriate** - Technical details in GitHub, business value in Linear
- **Milestone-Based** - Progress indicators, not time estimates

## üöÄ Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow
1. **Task Initialization** (`/cook`) - Orchestrator analyzes requirements
2. **Resource Planning** - Determines complexity and allocates agents
3. **Implementation** - Specialized agents execute their domains
4. **Quality Gates** - QA approval required before deployment
5. **Integration** - GitHub agent manages repository interactions
6. **Deployment** - Automated release management with monitoring

### Branch Management
- **Naming Convention**: `<username>/<issue-id>` (e.g., `steve/ENG-123`)
- **No Direct Commits** - All changes via PR process
- **Linear Integration** - Ticket IDs in all branch names and commits
- **Protected Main** - Main branch requires PR and reviews

## üìä Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints covered
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user paths validated
- **Performance**: <200ms API response times
- **Security**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Code Quality Gates
- All tests passing
- Code coverage above thresholds
- Security scan clean
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility validated
- Documentation complete

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Time Estimates** - Use milestone completion percentages

- **Secret Exposure** - No API keys, tokens, or sensitive data in commits
- **Generic Commits** - Avoid "fix", "update", "changes" without context
- **Direct Main Commits** - All changes must go through PR process
