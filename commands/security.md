# Security Audit

Execute comprehensive security analysis using the security-auditor specialist:

## Primary Security Review
Use security-auditor agent for comprehensive analysis:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- Authentication/authorization review (JWT, OAuth2)
- Input validation and injection prevention  
- Encryption implementation verification
- Security headers and CSP policies
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Secondary Analysis  
1. Search for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens
2. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
3. Look for XSS vulnerabilities in web code
4. Review authentication and authorization logic
5. Check for insecure dependencies
6. Look for sensitive data exposure
7. Review error handling for information disclosure

Focus area (if provided): $ARGUMENTS

## Output
- Security audit report with severity levels
- Recommended fixes with implementation code
- Security checklist for deployment
- Test cases for security scenarios
